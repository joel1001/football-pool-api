To run the project, follow this order:

1. Start the **Config Service** first. This provides configuration to all other microservices.
2. Then start the **Eureka Service** (service discovery).
3. After Eureka is running, start the **Gateway Service**.
4. Finally, start the rest of the microservices as needed (users, interviews, jobs, etc).

This order ensures that all services can register and obtain their configuration correctly.

## Microservices Overview

- **Config Service**: Centralized configuration server. Supplies configuration files to all other microservices at startup.

- **Eureka Service**: Service discovery. All microservices register here so they can find and communicate with each other dynamically.

- **Gateway Service**: API Gateway. Routes external requests to the appropriate microservice, handles cross-cutting concerns like security, rate limiting, and CORS.

- **Users Service**: Manages user accounts, authentication, and user profile data.

- **Interviews Service**: Handles interview logic, including AI-driven interviews, interview scheduling, and storing interview results.

- **Job Service**: Manages job postings, job details, and job-related queries.

- **Companies Service**: Manages company profiles and company-related data.

- **Candidate Service**: Handles candidate profiles, applications, and candidate-specific operations.

- **Notifications Service**: Sends notifications (email, SMS, etc.) to users and candidates.

- **Payment Service**: Manages payment processing and billing operations.

- **User Feedback Service**: Collects and manages feedback from users about the platform or services.

Each microservice is independent, communicates via REST (or other protocols), and is registered/discovered through Eureka. The Gateway Service is the main entry point for external clients.
